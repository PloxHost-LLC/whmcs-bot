# whmcs-bot

This was coded by myself & https://plox.host/

## State of code
The bot is buggy, but works. I started to integrate a system to lookup clients by their email. 
Here's what needs to be updated
- Update to D.JS 12
- Finish the upgrade for email lookup
- Change GetTickets to search by the email/CID instead of scanning through the whole output
- Fix bugs

## How to use it
Well firstly you need to own a WHMCS license, the bot needs permissions to:
- GetClientsDetails
- getclientsProducts
- GetTickets

If you want to use the linking system you need to setup a system on your WHMCS which sends a request to the webhook. I will eventully release the code for the webhook.
